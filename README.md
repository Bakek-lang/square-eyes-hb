# Square Eyes 

Welcome to the GitHub page for Square Eyes! This project was all about creating a movie website over a semester for school. It's designed to look like a place where you can buy movies, but it's really just a frontend project. So, you can browse and pick movies, add them to a cart, but there's no actual buying involved.

## Description

Square Eyes is a frontend project that mimics an online movie store. It was created as part of a school assignment and is meant to showcase how a movie buying website works, except the buying part is just for show.

### Features

- **Movie Browsing:** It is set up a bunch of movies on the site within different categories so you can scroll trhough and see what it would be like if you were shopping.
- **Cart System:** You can add movies to a cart just like a real online store. It's all part of making it feel real, even though you can't actually buy the movies.
- **Designed for Users:** The whole point was to make something that looks and feels like a movie website. It should be easy to navigate and fun to use.
